# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description
This project involves implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an `n x n` 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The solution requires understanding matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python.

## Concepts Needed

- **Matrix Representation in Python**:
  - Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
  - Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.

- **In-place Operations**:
  - Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
  - Minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.

- **Matrix Transposition**:
  - Swapping rows and columns of a matrix.
  - Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.

- **Reversing Rows in a Matrix**:
  - Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order.

- **Nested Loops**:
  - Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
  - Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.

## Requirements
- **General**:
  - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
  - All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.10)
  - All files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
  - Code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.8.0)
  - No modules can be imported
  - All modules and functions must be documented
  - All files must be executable
