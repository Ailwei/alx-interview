# Island Perimeter

## Description

This project calculates the perimeter of an island in a grid. The grid is represented by a 2D list of integers, where `1` represents land and `0` represents water. The objective is to determine the perimeter of the island defined by the land cells.

## Concepts and Skills

To successfully complete this project, you need to be familiar with the following concepts:

- **2D Arrays (Matrices)**:
  - Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
  - Navigating through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).
  
- **Conditional Logic**:
  - Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.
  
- **Counting Techniques**:
  - Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.
  
- **Python Programming**:
  - Using nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
  - Implementing conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
- No external modules are allowed
- All modules and functions must be documented
- All files must be executable
