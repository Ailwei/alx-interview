## Objective
For the "0. Change comes from within" project, you will tackle a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project challenges you to apply your understanding of algorithms to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient.

## Concepts Needed

### Greedy Algorithms
- **Understanding:** How greedy algorithms work and why they are suitable for the coin change problem.
- **Limitations:** Recognizing the limitations of greedy algorithms and scenarios where they might not provide the optimal solution.

### Dynamic Programming
- **Basic Principles:** Using dynamic programming to solve optimization problems.
- **Key Concepts:** Overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in the context of the coin change problem.

### Algorithmic Complexity
- **Analysis:** Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms.
- **Optimization:** Striving for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Decomposition:** Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
- **Approaches:** Iterative vs. recursive approaches to dynamic programming.

### Python Programming
- **List Manipulation:** Using and manipulating lists and list comprehensions.
- **Efficient Coding:** Implementing functions with efficient looping and conditional statements.
